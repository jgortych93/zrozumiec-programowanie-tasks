1. Filter out characters outside range 0F:

        - parse the text sign by sign
2. The filtered chars should be placed in char array (two signs per byte):

    - Wait for two signs to count a number and write it to the array

3. Check if number of ones in given byte is even:

    - Iterate through the number with performing AND operation with 1 that's being moved to the left and check if the numbe of ones is even

4. Two arrays should be created:

    - put the output values to two vectors and sort the one with even number of ones in ascending order and the other one should be sorted in descedning        
     order
